# tips

XP's tips collection. View it online: https://drmingdrmer.github.io/tips/ .
This site is [logseq](https://logseq.com/) based, and is published online with [logseq-github-action](https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-publish).

I'm too stupid to remember things. I have to write things down for the future me.
And in the hope that they will help anyone who wish to learn these things, I've tried to make these tips less academic.


**Directory layout**:


- `/tips`: well-formatted articles.

- `/pages`, `/assets`, `/journals`, `logseq` and `/draws` are [logseq](https://logseq.com/) maintained
    dir.
